# Flight Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project analyzes a large dataset of flight information, focusing on aspects such as departure delays, airline performance, airport networks, and more. It uses Python to process the data and generate insightful visualizations.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Analysis of departure delays
- Airline performance comparison
- Flight network visualization
- Identification of busiest airports
- Correlation analysis of flight-related factors

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/barleviatias/flight_reserch.git
   cd flight_reserch
   ```

3. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the Google Drive file ID for the flight data CSV. If not provided in the script, replace `file_id` in `flight_data_analysis.py` with the correct ID.

2. Run the analysis script:
   ```
   python flight_data_analysis.py
   ```

3. The script will:
   - Download the data from Google Drive
   - Clean and preprocess the data
   - Perform various analyses
   - Generate visualizations
   - Create a summary report

## Output

After running the script, you will find:

- `flights_cleaned.csv`: Cleaned version of the original dataset
